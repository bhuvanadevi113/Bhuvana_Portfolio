# MYSQL-Data Cleaning & Exploratory Data Analysis

This project involved cleaning and analyzing employee layoff data to identify trends and patterns.

## Data cleaning
The layoffs that occurred globally are the subject of this data set. We take the actions listed below to sanitize the data.

### 1.Eliminate duplicates 
This is to see if the data contains any duplicates. Duplicates must be eliminated if they exist.
### 2.Standardize the data 
If there are any spelling mistakes or inconsistencies with other comparable data, they need to be fixed.The data should therefore appear uniform.
### 3.Null values/blank values 
Determine the null values.We'll see if we can fill in any values or if the nulls are genuine. 
### 4.Eliminate unnecessary columns 
Eliminate unnecessary columns that are not relevant to the analysis.

## Exploratory Data Analysis 
Used SQL to find specific trends, such as increased layoffs in particular industries and companies and total number of layoffs.
